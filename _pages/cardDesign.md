User interface is controlled from the cards tab. The node structure of your resource model will be shown by the card tree on the left. Each NodeGroup defined by a semantic node makes up one card. Each node in a NodeGroup is controlled by a widget on that NodeGroups card. You can click on a semantic node to view the card for its NodeGroup, or click on a node to jump to its card and select its widget.
