To create a new record, go to the "Add New Resource" tab and select the resource model that best fits for the record you want to create.  

![Create Record]({{site.url}}/assets/images/newRecordAnnotated.png)

# Resource Structure
Once you have selected a resource model, your record will be displayed as a "card tree" on the left hand side.  

![Card Tree]({{site.url}}/assets/images/cardTreeAnnotated.png)  

You can think of creating data within your record as adding cards. Some cards are nested within other cards to give more structure to records.
## Branches
Branches are a non-editable version of a resource model that can be used in multiple records and types of resources. Branches allow you to reuse complex node structures across multiple records.
## Cards
Each field that data can be entered into on a card is a node that can be set to a value depending on its datatype.
